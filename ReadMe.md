# ASA24 Load Test Project

## References

Two dlls are checked in with the project:

- Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.LoadTestFramework v10.0.0.0
- Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.WebTestFramework v10.0.0.0 

These should both be installed with Visual Studio Enterprise. They are on my workstation. However they are not installed
on other machines and I do not know why. These libraries are not available through nuget. Put them in to source control
so the project is portable.
